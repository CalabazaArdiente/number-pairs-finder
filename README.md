# Number Pairs Finder

This program finds pairs of integers from a given list that sum to a target value. The algorithm is implemented to be more efficient than O(n^2) and returns the correct results for all possible inputs.

## Usage

The program is executed from the command line and takes two arguments: a comma-separated list of integers and the target sum.

```shell
python app.py 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
```
The output will display the pairs of numbers that sum up to the target value:
```shell
+ 12, 0
+ 5, 7
+ 16, -4
```
## Requirements

Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-pairs-finder.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd number-pairs-finder

## Usage

1. Run the program with the desired input:
    python app.py <list_of_numbers> <target_sum>
    
2. Replace <list_of_numbers> with a comma-separated list of integers, and <target_sum> with the target sum.

3. View the output, which will display the pairs of numbers that sum up to the target value.
